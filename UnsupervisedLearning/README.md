# Unsupervised Learning

There is one unsupervised learning algorithm performed in this sub-repository. The K Means Clustering algorithm is coded from scratch. The algorithm is performed in two different datasets, one of which is from the class example.

**Definition of Unsupervised Learning**

The difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning is that the data for supervised learning has both the input features and the output labels, while the data for unsupervised learning only has the input features without the output labels. And thus, the algorithm need to work on its own to learn the structure or distribution of the data.

There are two types of unsupervised learning method, clustering and association.

* Clustering: group the data points into categories with similar features. [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/cissyyang1014/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/tree/main/UnsupervisedLearning/K%20Means%20Clustering) is the most common algorithm for clustering.
* Association: find the relationships between variables, for example, people who adopt a dog most likely to buy new kinds of dog food.
