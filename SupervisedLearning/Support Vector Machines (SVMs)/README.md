### Dataset

* Processed 3k PBMCs Dataset:

The [Processed 3k PBMCs](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.datasets.pbmc3k_processed.html) Dataset is loaded from [scanpy.datasets](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-scanpy.datasets). The Processed 3k Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) Dataset consists of 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor and are freely available from [10x Genomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc3k). There are 2,700 single cells that were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500.
