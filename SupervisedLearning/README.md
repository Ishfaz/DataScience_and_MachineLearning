# Supervised Learning

There are nine supervised learning algorithms perfomed in this sub-repository. Most of the algorithms is coded from scratch. Each algorithm is performed in two different datasets, one of which is from the class example.

**Definition of Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning is widely used in practice. Supervising means helping the model to predict the right things. In supervised learning, each example consists of a set of input objects (features) and a desired output value (labels), and the algorithm learns the patterns between the input and the output. The learning precess is just like to be taught by a teacher that the correct answers (labels) are known and the algorithm iteratively makes predictions which would be corrected by the teacher.

There are two types of supervised learning methods, regression and classification.
* Regression: the output variable is a continuous value, such as "price" or "height". [Linear Regression](https://github.com/cissyyang1014/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/tree/main/SupervisedLearning/Linear%20Regression) is the most used regression algorithm.
* Classification: the output variable is a category, such as "green" or "blue", and "apple" or "banana". Commom algorithms are [Decision Tree](https://github.com/cissyyang1014/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/tree/main/SupervisedLearning/Decision%20Tree), and [K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/cissyyang1014/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/tree/main/SupervisedLearning/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20(KNN)).

Some algorithms can be used in both regression and classification problems, such as [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/cissyyang1014/DataScience_and_MachineLearning/tree/main/SupervisedLearning/Logistic%20Regression).
