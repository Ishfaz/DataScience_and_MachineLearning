This module mainly focuses on using Gradient Descent to solve linear regression problems.

Content in **Gradient Descent** module:
* Image: folder containing images used in README
* Data: folder containing datasets
  - penguins.csv: Penguins Dataset
* Lec 4.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing 
  - 1) Introduction of Gradient Descent algorithm
  - 2) Implement :
    * Part 1: find a best linear model for a data with 4 data points using Gradient Descent.
    * Part 2: use the Gradient Descent to find a linear regression model to predict the body mass of penguin by the flipper length.
